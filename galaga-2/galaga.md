[Galaga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga) is a classic arcade game that
first appeared in 1979, as a sequal to Galaxian. The goal of the game is to
pilot your space ship, shooting down flying aliens, while avoiding their
missiles. Despite being relased 33 years ago, Galaga and similar spinoffs are
still popular, appearing on smartphones and Xbox Live Arcade.
